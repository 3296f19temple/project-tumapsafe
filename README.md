## Personas

### Angela 
Angela is a sophomore at Temple University and she is a Film and Media Arts major. 
In her free time, Angela likes to watch foreign movies, come up with short film ideas, and play video games. 
She also has an active social life and enjoys getting out and making the most of her college years.

Angela was born and raised in northwestern Pennsylvania. 
She lived on campus during her freshman year but now she lives in a small apartment in northern Philadelphia 
near campus because she finds it to be more convenient and cost-effective. 
She rides a bicycle to and from her classes almost every day 
(with the exception of severe weather days, during which she takes public transportation) 
since she lives far enough that walking would be a burden but close enough that bicycling would be better than taking a bus or train. 

Angela has not fully acclimated to the city yet since she is relatively new to Philadelphia. 
She still doesn’t know as much about the city as she wants to know so she needs help feeling safer 
when she’s going back to her apartment after some late activities on campus or a late night out with her friends. 
She doesn’t want the fear of the unknown to come in the way of her studies or her social life.

## Persona 2
### Bill, a student 
Bill, is 18 years old and freshman at Temple University and he is a computer science major. He likes to watch films, play video games and hang out with his colleagues. Bill is from New York and lives in apartment in north Philadelphia near the university because of the time management. He walks to and from classes every day to save time and money.

Therefore, he wants to explore the city, so he needs help feeling safer when he is going back to his apartment. He wants to use technology which would help him to feel secure while walking and which area to avoid from the risk.

            TU MapSafe is an application that can more intuitively and effortlessly 
            interpret TU Alerts and provide direct access to police and other safety resources. 
            Unlike the existing campus alert notification system, 
            our product provides a mapped interface that shows the user their proximity to 
            the incident, threat, etc. allowing them to react accordingly.
